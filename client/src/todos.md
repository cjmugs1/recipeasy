<!-- do not care about tests for the moment. we will want to change every function in tests to match our updated reducer names -->

<!-- question for TA's: do we put our apps images and assets in the public side, or the src side assets folder? It is probably src because it is a protected folder, but we still want to clarify-->

<!-- For components, we will want to rename folders to be component names that are relevant to Recipeasy-->
# Components for React.js

<!-- General Page Components -->
## Header 
## Navigation
## Footer

<!-- Main components -->
<!-- As we talked about with Ulises, it is better to do everything for the main component on one long index.js file. In this file we have the functions that handle user input, as well as the complete react components being returned -->
<!-- In each main component, we are going to want to import our AntDesign components (refer to the ant design docs to see how) -->
